- **7/24/2022** 📢 Code Sharing Agreement
  1. In order to help meetup attendees understand the labs, we will cover labs in meetup lectures. We will also share different answers from Github Classroom. 
  2. If you are using Github Classroom for your labs, which means your granted us the permission to share your lab solution during meetup. Please let us know by email if you have any question on this.
  3. We also encourage meetup attendees to share their solutions during the meetup. 
- **7/22/2022** ❓Below are some questions you can think about before the Saturday meetup
  1. Can you name some pros and cons for the 3-layer page table design? How does Translation Look-aside Buffer mitigate some of the issues that 3-layer page table brings?
  2. What are `sfence.vma` and `satp` instructions in RISC-V?
  3. Why does bloom filter, an efficient set membership lookup data structure, are not used in page table lookups? 
  4. Can you describe, in words, how to walk through the page tables to find the correct physical address? 
  5. What are the benefits of direct mapping from VA to PA? (direct mapping examples: PLIC, VIRIO disk, Kernel Text, PHYSTOP)
  6. If Xv6 is written in a memory-safe programming language, like Rust, does it still need to worry about strong isolation between processes? Does it still need seperation of kernel and user mode?
  7. Why does Xv6 emulate page table look ups, isn't this supported by the RISC-V hardware? 
- **7/17/2022** Lab 2: Syscalls has been updated. please use this [link](https://classroom.github.com/a/Eq_sInZr) to clone your private repo. Please remember that **NEVER** share code publically and **NEVER** make the repo public. The first lab is due on 📅 Saturday 7/30/2022. You can directly `git push` to your repo to submit your lab assignment. 
- **7/17/2022** Thanks for joining our second OS meetup! Here is a brief summary of the post-meetup discussion:
  - Here are some [examples](http://unikernel.org/projects/) of unikernels.
  - [Redox OS](https://www.redox-os.org/) is a new microkernel based operating system written in Rust
  - A process has a user stack and a kernel stack. The user stack is addressed by some special stack registers.
    - In X86, `ebp` is the base pointer for the current stack frame and `esp` is is the current stack pointer.
    - Typically you would see something like

        ```asm
        push EBP
        mov  EBP, ESP
        sub  ESP, <some_number>
        ```

    - In RISC-V, there are `sp` and `ra`, which stands for stack pointer and return address. RISC-V stack always grows downwards, and it always points to the last used place on the stack. `Push` decrements `sp` and `pop` increments `sp`.
  - C undefined behaviors are C programs that may output unexpected results. For example, if you access out-of-bounds array, or dereference a null pointer, the program may crash, or may output unexpected results.
  - Process address space is divided to different segments: text, data, heap, stack, and so on. A segmentation fault occurs when the program tries to access an address that is not in the segment, or attempt to write to an read-only segment.
- **7/15/2022** Wen Lin and Mossaka will hold an office hour for answering lab 1 questions! Come and talk about Xv6! [Zoom link](https://zoom.us/j/96343577905?pwd=NTF6V1pkSXZDVHdHZTZNS1pxamFLZz09).
- **7/15/2022** ❓Below are some questions you can think about before the Saturday meetup
  1. In the book, it says that every process has a user stack and a kernel stack. Where is user stack defined in `proc.h`?
  2. What are `mret` and `sret` instructions in RISC-V?
  3. How is microkernel different from unikernel? Can you name some examples of monokernel, microkernel, and unikernel? What is microVM?
  4. Can you describe, in full detail, how Xv6 boostraps and runs the first user process?
  5. Explain what are "undefined behaviours" in C language
  6. What is segmentation fault in C program?
- **7/14/2022** 📅 Reminder: Lab 1 Util is due on this **Saturday 7/16/2022 at 5:00 P.M. PST**. We will hold a post-lab happy hour 🎉 on Saturday at the end of our meetup. 
- **7/10/2022** Lab 1 Util Github Classroom has been updated. Please click [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/q4I5zsip) to get a fork. Please remember that **NEVER** share code publically and **NEVER** make the repo public. The first lab is due on 📅 Saturday 7/16/2022. You can directly `git push` to your repo to submit your lab assignment. 
- **7/10/2022** Thanks for joining our first OS meetup! Here are the links we shared:
  - [Mossaka]: recommends a textbook alternative: [Operating Systems, Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
  - [Mossaka]: this is a good [article](https://gendignoux.com/blog/2020/06/16/rust-5-years-cross-platform.html#desktop-systems) to learn more about how high-level programming languages like Rust makes cross-platform stdlib.
  - [Morgan Wu]: mentioned [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX#POSIX-certified) which is quiet an interesting work.
  - [Mossaka]: Check out [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) (WebAssembly System Interface) to learn how to build a POSIX-like system for WebAssembly that lives on the browser.
  - Post-meetup, we talked about a system interface for the cloud is a missing piece in the modern cloud-era. It would greatly benefit those who want to migrate one cloud to another, or to build cloud-native systems that use both cloud and on-premise, or simply don't want to be locked in to a particular cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.).
  - [go-cloud](https://github.com/google/go-cloud) is an interesting work that provides a "stable, idiomatic interfaces for common uses like storage and databases".
  - Change Data Capture (mentioned in DDIA Chap 11) is another great example of building abstraction on heterogeneous database systems to extract logs out and process them as events. 
  - [David]: mentioned [Debezium](https://debezium.io/), which is an open source distributed platform for change data capture, and it's associated paper [DBlog](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12597v1.pdf)
Next week, Mossaka will present Lecture 2: OS Organization and System Calls. Our lab util is due on Saturday 7/16/2022. We will go through some of the hard questions during the meetup. 
- **7/5/2022:** Our first meetup will be presented by Mossaka and Wen Lin on **July 9th, 2022 at 5:00pm PST**! We will introduce our org, the os-meetup and the schedule. The second half of the meetup, we will introduce operating systems, and discuss **lecture 1** and our reading material **chapter 1**! We call for vonlunteer meetup presenter signups! 
- **6/27/2022:** Our schedule is updated! 
- **5/31/2022:** Our first meetup is scheduled to be held on the **July 9th, 2022** 🎉! We will be learning and discussing [MIT 6.S081 Fall 2021](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2021/schedule.html) together! The schedule, zoom link and other info will be posted soon.
    
    > **Note:** Starting Fall 2020, MIT 6.828 is offered as two courses: [6.S018](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2021/schedule.html) (intro to OS) and [6.828](https://abelay.github.io/6828seminar/index.html) (research focused).
